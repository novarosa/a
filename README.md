# a

## dependencies
- make
- cc

*Nota bene*: The goal for this code is to be as portable as possible but
I am aware that is largely not possible. Testing is currently done on
the following platforms:

- FreeBSD 14 with bmake and clang
- macOS 13 with gmake and clang
- Fedora 40 with gmake and gcc

## synopsis
```console
$ make && ./a
```
